Created a README.md file

I created a simple TodoList which manages tasks.
The user should be able to do these things:

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Change a tasks status (complete/incomplete)

It is also possible to display the whole TodoList, so that the user can see all the tasks with their status at once.


In order for the code to be well structured and organized, I will create different files and with that also show good filhantering. 
For the beginning I will start with three files and later on I will add or restructure my files if necessary. Most propably I will need to add some more files but that is the fun of it, learning by doing.
