Created a README.md file

I created a simple TodoList which manages tasks.
The user should be able to do these things:

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Change a tasks status (complete/incomplete)

It is also possible to display the whole TodoList, so that the user can see all the tasks with their status at once.

In order for the code to be well structured and organized, I will create different files and with that also show good filhantering.
For the beginning I will start with three files and later on I will add or restructure my files if necessary. Most propably I will need to add some more files but that is the fun of it, learning by doing.

Changes:

After Benjamins feedback, I will try to make some changes to the code to make it work more effectively. I will try to find a solution to not have to rerun the code each time after one application. 

After that I want to make the application case-insensitive. The problem was that the application is case-sensitive when i want to add, remove or complete a task. 

I want to add another function: 
- Be able to add the priority level of a new added task, which will be automatically saved on the csv file.

The next thing I want to do is to provide the user with another functionality, namely the possibility to change the priority status whenever they want. If they chose 1, it means that it is the most important task while 2 means medium important and 3 means less important.
